## Preparing Variables

The variables I will use in the beginning:
  - Monthly Change of CPI Motor
  - Monthly Change of Oil and Gasoline Futures
  - Daily volatility of Oil and Gasoline Futures
  - Weekly volatility of Oil and Gasoline Futures 

```{r importing}
library(tidyverse)
data <- readRDS("data/preppedData.rds")
```

# Prediction 1: Fitting a simple VAR model on historical data

```{r}

```


## Deciding number of lags 

## Adding seasonality

# Prediction 2: Fitting a simple VAR on last 5 years only

# Prediction 3: Deciding the window of VAR training by performance

# Prediction 4: Adding Import/Export Data

# Prediction 5: Paper Replication
